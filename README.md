## Overview

The cosmos provide an interesting candidate for visualization. It encompasses a wide variety of the phenomena, many of which involve spectacular color or immense scales. Animation is also an interesting opportunity to simulate interaction between objects (gravitational attraction, collision, EM interference, chemical/nuclear reactions, etc.). I've been interested in exploring both visualization and simulation in the Rust programming language, for which this project is a good opportunity.

## Why Rust
Rust is not commonly used for data crunching or game development, but in the future it might be. Rust makes it easy to cleanly interface with external libraries, build for different architectures, and write high level code that is still very fast. It also provides strong safety guarantees, which help to verify data integrity and security.
